# Study Guide for New BootCamp Students

## Description

Welcome to the New Student Study Guide! As a new student to bootcamp, I want a way to keep track of some of the information I am learning. This study guide allows me to list out some important points about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript as well as ramdomly prompt me to review these topics as I prepare to move forward through my bootcamp journey. This webpage is made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and has given me the opportunity to see how all three work together. Frequent use of Git has also helped me become more familiar with the Git workflow. The knowledge learned here will help me as I prepare to dig deeper into these topics.
